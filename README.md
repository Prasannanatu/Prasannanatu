### <h1> Hi there 👋 I am Prasanna 
### About me 🤔 :
I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Mumbai. My passion lies in fostering innovation, sustainability, and bringing research to life. I strongly believe that predicting the future is all about building it and that big thinking can turn possibilities into realities.  
  
  The transition from a mechanical background to robotics has been challenging, but the reward has been worth the effort.  
  My core education includes Perception, Machine Learning, Controls as well as Deep Learning.  
  
  Outside of my studies, my hobbies include playing cricket, hiking, playing Indian classical instruments, and solving random math problems.
